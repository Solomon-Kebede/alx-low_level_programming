[2-O] What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?
[3-O] What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?
[4-O] What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
[5-O] What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
[6-O] What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
```C
int **allocate_map(int n, int m)
{
     int **map;

     map = malloc(sizeof(int *) * n);
     for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
     {
          map[i] = malloc(sizeof(int) * m);
     }
     return (map);
}
```
